1 For the given JSON ilerate over all for the loop?
                                                   
    var arr = [ {"id":"10", "class": "child-of-9"}, {"id":"11", "class": "child-of-10"}];
    
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
  document.write("<br><br>array index: " + i);
  var obj = arr[i];
  for (var key in obj){
    var value = obj[key];
    document.write("<br> - " + key + ": " + value);

3 Read about the diffrent between window,screen,and document in javascript?
Briefly, with more detail below,

w

window:

  -> Each browser tab has its own top-level window object.
  ->Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object.
  ->window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.
  ->top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.
  ->In addition to document and screen described below, window properties include
  ->setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
  ->location giving the current URL
  ->history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
  ->navigator describing the browser software document



Document:

  ->Each window object has a document object to be rendered. 
  ->These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the HTML snippet

Screen:

  ->The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
  ->screen properties width and height are the full screen
  ->screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
  ->The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript,
  ->which is potentially confusing because we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system. 
  ->The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.
